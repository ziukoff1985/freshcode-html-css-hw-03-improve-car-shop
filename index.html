          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            The Ford Motor Company was founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903.
            Its goal was to make the automobile accessible to the general
            public, not just the wealthy. This ambitious idea was brought to
            life through the implementation of assembly line production, which
            significantly reduced the cost of assembling cars. The legendary
            Ford Model T, released in 1908, became a symbol of mass
            motorization. It was so popular that over 15 million units were sold
            by 1927. Over the years, Ford continued to innovate, expanding its
            model range and introducing new technologies, allowing the brand to
            remain one of the leaders in the global automotive industry.

          <p>
            The history of Toyota Motor Corporation began in 1937 when Kiichiro
            Toyoda founded the automotive company as a spin-off from Toyota
            Industries, which produced weaving looms. Toyota's main philosophy
            has always been the pursuit of excellence and continuous
            improvement, known as "Kaizen." The company became a global leader
            thanks to its innovative production systems, which ensured high
            quality, efficiency, and reliability. It is thanks to this that
            Toyota has earned the trust of millions of consumers worldwide,
            offering cars known for their durability and low operating costs.

          <p>
            Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) was founded in 1916 in Munich,
            Germany. Initially, the company was engaged in the production of
            aircraft engines, hence the distinctive logo symbolizing a rotating
            propeller against a blue sky. After World War I, BMW switched to
            manufacturing motorcycles, and the first car, the BMW 3/15 Dixi, was
            released in 1928. Since then, BMW has gained worldwide recognition
            due to its focus on sportiness, luxury, innovation, and engineering
            excellence. BMW cars are known for their powerful engines, excellent
            handling, and premium quality, making them desirable for lovers of
            dynamic driving.
